title: Support me!
---
I spend a lot of time working on projects, writing documentation, and just being there to talk to.

If you have found my work useful, there are many ways you can show your support. Any help is appreciated, no matter how small you may think it is.

# Send me a tip
There are currently **no advertisements** on my website and I only make money from the generosity of **people like you**!

You can [support me on Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/pumpkinhasapatch) with one-time or recurring payments.

# Help with code
Most of my code is hosted publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/pumpkinhaspatch). You can fork my code and make any changes you want, then send [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests) to improve my projects.

If you are less tech-savvy, you can look for bugs and [report an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues) to get them fixed.
