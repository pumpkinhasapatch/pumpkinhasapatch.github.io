There are many ways you can show your love for my work. I spend a lot of time working on projects, writing documentation, and just being there to talk to.

# Send me money
There are currently **no advertisements** on my website and I only make money from the generosity of **people like you**!

You can sponsor me on the following platforms with one-time or recurring payments:

# Help with code
You can fork my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/pumpkinhaspatch) and make any changes you want. You can then send pull requests to improve my projects. If you have found something wrong, you can report an issue to get it fixed.
