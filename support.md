There are many ways you can show your love for my work.

# Donations
I spend a lot of time working on projects, writing documentation, and just being there to talk to. There are **no ads** on my website and I only make money from direct donations.

You can sponsor me on the following platforms with one-time or recurring payments:
- [Ko-Fi ![Support me on Ko-Fi](img/icons/icons8-ko-fi.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/pumpkinhasapatch)


# Help with code
You can fork my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/pumpkinhaspatch) and make any changes you want. You can then send pull requests to improve my projects. If you have found something wrong, you can report an issue to get it fixed.
